        <p>Welcome to my site. How very unfortunate for you to have found it. <br>
          My site contains no valuable information as of yet(if ever). <br>
          If you'd like to be entertained however, please keep reading.</p>

          <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
          <p>I have just recently dabbled into this and it's like a whole new world to me. <br>
            I have no idea what I'm doing half of the time but somehow it works out just fine in the end.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-row2">
          <h3>Irrelevant but OK</h3>
          <p>I can cook some great stuff, even at a first try. I can also cook some questionable stuff, but that doesn't count. <br>
             I'm also good at coming up with lyrics and rhymes. <br>
             Other than that I'm just awesome and naturally gorgeous, and very humble.
